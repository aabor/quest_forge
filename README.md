# QuestForge: MindMaze Chronicles

Welcome to QuestForge: MindMaze Chronicles, a mind-bending quest where logic is your greatest weapon.

Step into a world where every choice is a test of reason. Whether uncovering a hidden treasure, solving a murder mystery, or unmasking a spy, the fate of your journey lies in the power of deduction.

Select your era—will you navigate the cunning courts of the Renaissance, the shadowed alleys of Ancient Rome, or the high-tech intrigue of the modern world? With each choice, a unique adventure unfolds, shaped by the power of Large Language Models and visual generative AI.

Your quest is not just about instinct—it’s about logic. Each puzzle is bound by the laws of reason, guided by first and second-order logic and the paradoxes of De Morgan. Only those who think critically will uncover the truth.

With just three screens, your time is limited. Make the right choices, and you will triumph. Falter, and the mystery will remain unsolved.

Will you crack the code—or be lost to the enigma?
